# Doggo Lens üê∂üîç

## Basic Details
### Team Name:Onninum Kollaathavar

### Team Members
- Member 1: R Vaishnav Raj - College of Engineering Trivandrum
- Member 2: Gopika Sreekumar - College of Engineering Trivandrum

### Project Description
Google Lens, but for campus dogs. Take a picture of a dog in CET, and instantly know their name, how friendly or aggressive they are, what food lures them in, their favorite campus hangouts, their biggest triggers, and even their bite history ‚Äî complete with people's reviews.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
You‚Äôre walking through CET. A cute dog stares at you. Is it a friend? Is it a foe? Or is it the one that bit Noel Chettan last semester? The suspense is unbearable. We must solve this *pressing* issue.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built **Doggo Lens** ‚Äî an AI-powered lens that lets you snap a dog‚Äôs pic and get its full profile: name, friendliness score (1‚Äì10), triggers, favorite snacks, campus location habits, bite stats, and user-submitted reviews. It‚Äôs like Tinder, but for knowing whether you should pet or run.
